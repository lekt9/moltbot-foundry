# Swarms.world Listing for Foundry

**URL:** https://swarms.world/launch?type=agent

## Agent Details

**Name:** Foundry

**Type:** Agent

**Tags:** self-improvement, meta-learning, recursive, code-generation, workflow-automation, openclaw

## Description

**The forge that forges itself.**

Foundry is a self-writing meta-extension for OpenClaw that learns how you work, researches documentation, and upgrades itself to match your patterns.

### Three Capabilities

1. **Observes** your workflows (goal → tools → outcome)
2. **Researches** docs + writes extensions/skills/hooks
3. **Crystallizes** patterns into tools (8 calls → 1 command)

### How It Works

The Overseer runs hourly — auto-crystallizing high-value patterns (5+ uses, 70%+ success), pruning stale ones, tracking tool fitness.

**Knowledge vs Behavior:**
- Knowledge (prompts) = tokens every call, can be forgotten
- Behavior (self-written code) = zero tokens, always executes

Foundry writes behavior, not just knowledge.

### The Recursive Loop

```
Observe how you work
    ↓
Learn patterns, research docs
    ↓
Write tool to match your workflow
    ↓
Tool becomes part of Foundry
    ↓
Better Foundry learns more
    ↓
Repeat
```
